				<h2> Singapore, Singapore</h2>
				<p> Singapore is the home to a melting pot of cultures ranging from European, Southeast Asian, East Asian, and etc.
					This small island near the equator is the home to around more than 5 million people and considered one 
					of the wealthiest city-states. It boasts of energy and innovation, striving to excel whatever they do best. 
					But also, this small but dynamic island is somewhere I call home. Living here for 9 years, I have no regret. </p>

				<h2> Taipei, Taiwan</h2>
				<p> Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, is one of the most bustling cities in 
					the world. Home to one of the most beautiful skyscrapers, landscapes, and vivacious night life,
					the city is the embodiment of culture. Upon my visit, I was amazed at the natural scenery
					and how it was well integrated into the lifestyle of Taiwanese livelihood. Taipei is a city I would 
					love to revisit again. </p>

				<h2> Rome, Italy</h2>
				<p> Rome is something more than just the spot for a piping start of trends. It's a 
					place that holds thousands of years of pure history possibly giving us 
					explanations and answers we had about our past.  </p>
				<p> Upon my visit in the year 2019, I was amazed at how architecture from
					so many generations were able to stand still today. While standing in 
					this small civilization, it was as if time had stopped and I was surrounded
					by the ambience of art. </p>
