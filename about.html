			<p>
				As an undergraduate student, I had a passion for learning about how cultural values impacted political laws and sanctions.
				Growing up Korean American in Singapore, my entire life has been a concoction of different customs, which is why I love traveling. 
				The natural and architectural scenery has inspired the axiom of my life, creating a bountiful of relationships from people all over
				the world. I believe my multi-cultural and academic background is the perfect opportunity to understand and appreciate culture.
			</p>
			<p>
				The locations that I have shared with you are just a start to my neverending love for travel. The art and fashion of each scenery
				are an inspiration to all aspects of vivality. It screams of joy and color waiting for the right person to appreciate their values
				which starts with you. Take the iniative to explore the nooks and crannies of each continent and be ready to animate your life
			</p>
			<p>
				If you wish to contact me for any advices on travel plans, need my opinion for places to visit, etc.  please fill out the contact
				form so we can connect. I will be more than happy to answer any of your inquiries or to simply just talk :)
