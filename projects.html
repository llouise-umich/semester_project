		<h1> Return on Investment (ROI) Healthcare Dashboard</h1>
		<p class = "season"> Fall 2020 ----- Role: UX Researcher </p>
		<div class = "client">
			<h2> Client: AECOM</h2>
			<p> A large multinational consulting company is working to 
				develop recommendations on how workstations within an 
				in-patient healthcare facility (i.e. record-keeping, 
				data-keeping, administration and etc.) can be modified 
				to make workers more satisfied. Their recommendation aims 
				to enhance patient satisfaction and increase bottom-line. 
				The dashboard will communicate the dollar value of potential 
				implementations to client. </p>
		</div>
		<div class = "methodolog">
			<h3> Methodology and Considerations </h3>
			<p> By utilizing contextual inquiry, I was able to create an analysis 
				in order to learn more about current processes within my client's team. 
				Out of the 6 people our team has interviewed, I had led 4 of them. These
				interviews were managed to generate three key findings and three recommendations. </p>
			<p> I have conducted a background research on AECOM's market as well as the healthcare 
				technology industry to identify the methods to quantify ROI and extract information 
				on workplace design in the healthcare space. </p>
			<p> However, limitations existed in that we were not able to interview members of the 
				health system or have access to collected survey data about its patients and/or 
				employees because our client is working with due to confidentiality.</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "ideation">
			<h3> Ideation </h3>
			<p> Once all six interviews were completed, the aforementioned notes were aggregated 
				and grouped into clusters and analyzed them, a process that is common in contextual 
				inquiry. Soon after, I have summarized sentences for each group of notes and used these, 
				as well as my background research, as the basis for our team's findings and recommendations. 
				The summarizations were used to construct an affinity wall, shown on the right, in order to 
				identify the core problem.​​​​​​​</p>
